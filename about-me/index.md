I love to code. I guess there is no doubt about it. And if you still are a bit skeptical, then checkout my [Github profile](https://github.com/aniketpant).

I also [love to speak](/speaking). Though I haven't done this quite frequently but you might want to call me to your conference someday.

Along with all of the above, I am also the _Curator of [Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in)_, which is India's First Content &amp; Design Conference.
