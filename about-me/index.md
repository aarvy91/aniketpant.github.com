I love to code. I guess there is no doubt about it. And if you still are a bit skeptical, then checkout my [Github profile](https://github.com/aniketpant).

Along with all of the above, I am also the _Curator of [Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in)_, which is India's First Content &amp; Design Conference.
