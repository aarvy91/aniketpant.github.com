<p class="lead">Hey, I am <strong>Aniket</strong> and I have been around on the web since 2010. It's not long but it been quite an <a href="/archive">adventure</a> since then. In all this time I have worked with various web frameworks, built a number of applications, written hundreds of front-end code, refactored tonnes of old code and enjoyed every single bit of it.</p>

## So, what all do I do?

I love to code. I guess there is no doubt about it. And if you still are a bit skeptical, then check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/aniketpant) (my codes are very attractive).

[Speaking](/speaking) is one thing I really love to do. My talks range from topics on WordPress based geek-shit to Community based interactions.

Along with all of the above, I also founded **[Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in)**, which is India's First Content &amp; Design Conference.

## Initiate contact
Just go ahead and **[tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=aniket_pant&text=Hey)**. If you're afraid of that, then you can <a href="me@aniketpant.com?subject=Hey">drop a mail</a>. And if by any chance you're looking for my codes, then you can [geek around](https://github.com/aniketpant) on GitHub.
