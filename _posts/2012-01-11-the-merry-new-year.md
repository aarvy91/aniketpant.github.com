This year has been going really great so far. I haven't been able to write anything so far but will be regular now.

There are quite a lot of things that have kept me busy and happy at the same time. The two events I am managing for my college's festival [Quark 2012]( http://bits-quark.org) are going well.
I will soon share the problems I have created for one of the events. The other event is the treasure hunt and it's called [E-Dorado](http://edorado.bits-quark.org).

Apart from this I haven't been able to put much time into [dabbling](http://dabblet.com) and this is the only [good thing](http://dabblet.com/result/gist/1593706) I have been able to make so far.

A little list from my side to read:

1.  [Tools of the Trade](http://sachagreif.com/tools-of-the-trade) : A little post by Sacha Grief on the various design and UI kits you can go for
2.  [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js) : The most brilliant presentation tool I have ever seen and used.
3.  [High Quality Free Fonts for 2012](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/09/high-quality-free-fonts-2012) : A list of great free fonts you can go for, curated by Smashing Magazine

That would be all as of now and I need to learn CSS 3D Transforms now, they are quite amazing!
