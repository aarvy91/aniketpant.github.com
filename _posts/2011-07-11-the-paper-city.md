My city drowned<br/>
Dreams grew like a tree<br/>
Thoughts bloomed<br/>
Pin me up on your mind

I wish to hear your voice<br/>
Wake me up<br/>
Sing to me<br/>
And we'll build this city

Pin me up<br/>
Let me stay<br/>
Close your eyes<br/>
Dream a new day

You smile but why do these roses bleed<br/>
Am I sad or the city left me<br/>
This lavender love letter<br/>
Will it ever reach you, or just drown in the sky
