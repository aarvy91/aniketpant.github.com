This room is not what it seems like<br/>
Go see the painting on the wall<br/>
The future is painted in black and white<br/>
And if I'm not right, then you better be wrong.

Shed your inhibitions<br/>
Break these walls<br/>
Look outside<br/>
Feel the rain.

You don't need to search for the light<br/>
Come close to me my love<br/>
I'll show you the life in you<br/>
Stay near, don't ever leave.

Flowers give in to spring<br/>
Even the leaves fall in autumn<br/>
But the love we have will last<br/>
Till the stars shine in the skies.

I hope you won't ever go<br/>
The smile would last forever<br/>
And your beauty won't fade away<br/>
Just like this serenade will never end.
