Look upto the sky<br/>
Watch the rain fall<br/>
The dark days are over<br/>
Misery won't befall you

The light fades away<br/>
Show yourself<br/>
Don't be afraid<br/>
Watch the sun set

Come down to me<br/>
These words don't mean anything to you<br/>
You just want to kill everything you see<br/>
Your heart just says<br/>
Take everything, leave nothing

Don't you see these ashes<br/>
Haven't you seen the blood on the streets<br/>
What about the girl waiting for you?<br/>
Remember what she looks like!

Think when she waved goodbye<br/>
Hoping to see you again<br/>
Drop this gun<br/>
Head back to home

Leave this town<br/>
Back to where you came from<br/>
This is just another world<br/>
Another dream, come away with me!
