After a long time of illogical brainstorming, I finally got to know why form validation was not working in CodeIgniter (in one page.

You can see the question over [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7006552/form-validation-not-working-in-code-igniter-solved).

What actually happened is while declaring the rules for the validation, instead of writing `field`, I wrote `name`.

Just this much and my code started working. Now I am over to the next portion which is developing a search.

Also, yesterday I started using [TiddlyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/). It is a really nice thing to stored your journals. Try using it once for sure.
