A dark cloud over the moon<br/>
Cold air surrounds me<br/>
I wish I could make the sun bleed<br/>
And still feel you beside me

Summer is long gone<br/>
My pen is still ever since<br/>
These words will be alive soon

We will walk in the rain<br/>
And get drenched in love

I wonder if my thoughts could reach you like letters<br/>
Brown paper and a heart<br/>
But no tear in your eye

If you call for me<br/>
I want to be there<br/>
I wish I could<br/>
I feel I will

I want to make the stars paint your name in the sky<br/>
Write all my words<br/>
I, awake
