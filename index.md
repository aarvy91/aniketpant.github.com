I'm Aniket Pant. I write **syntax for design**.

At the moment I am working full time as the **Curator of Mark My Word** which is India's First Content and Design Conference.

Three of my tools are Codeigniter, Laravel and WordPress. But there is another power that I have which allows me to think of great application architectural designs. Other than that I love to speak at events and occasionally write poetry.

Over here, you will find me writing about web building, new technologies and anything new I find.

If you wish to consult me for any project, or if you want me to speak at an event, say hello.
