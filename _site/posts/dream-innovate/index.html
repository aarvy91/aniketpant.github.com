<p>Today, while going through Hacker News. Well, I read it regularly (like checking it every half an hour), and I read <a href='http://nymag.com/news/features/silicon-valley-2011-9/' title='Post.'>this</a> post.</p>

<p>It turned out to be the most inspiring thing I have ever read. I do not know how to be like <a href='http://www.feross.org/' title='Feross'>Feross</a> but I will try my best to be something close to him.</p>

<p>This semester in college, I made a plan to sit idle and innovate. Think the the whole day and come up with something that the WEB needs. As of now many people who I follow regularly are doing their best to make the web a better place. New open source applications keep coming up and people like me use them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love to experiment these experiments and try to use the ones I find for for my work, but soon I wish to create such things of my own. I have to, it’s a dream of mine.</p>

<p>The kind of job I would want is to develop, innovate and speak. Doesn’t it sound good? :)</p>

<p>Also, by the end of this year, I am seriously going to write something in <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/' title='A List Apart'>A List Apart</a>.</p>

<p>And by the end of October, a rewamp of my website with a clean <a href='http://csswizardry.com/' title='CSS Wizardry'>CSS Wizardry</a> like theme.</p>
