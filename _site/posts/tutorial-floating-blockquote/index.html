<p>You would have seen this at a number of places. There is a blockquote to one side and the content is flowing around it.</p>

<p>Go through the post if you have no idea about how to do it.</p>

<p>The HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is our blockquote floated to left with a fixed width&lt;br/&gt;Done using :nth-of-type property&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, &lt;a class=&quot;external ext&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; waved about helplessly as he looked. &quot;What&#39;s happened to me? &quot; he thought. It wasn&#39;t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.&lt;/p&gt;
