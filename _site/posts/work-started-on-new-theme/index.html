<p>I have lots of issues and I know it. I just can’t stick to one thing for a long time and it has again happened with me.<br />It’s not exactly a really big problem but I never feel content with what I have, so I have finally begun work on a new theme for my blog.</p>

<p>It’s always a good feeling when you work on something you truly like to put time in. My current blog is decent but in terms of overall planning, it ain’t that good as I made it in a couple of hours and never bothered to work on it again.</p>

<p>One of my funny habits is that I don’t put time on things that I have already made and don’t maintain them the way others do. (I do fix them if they become too obsolete, but only if they would be useful in the present)</p>

<p>My current plan of action for theme —</p>

<ol>
<li>I will be <em>dedicating one day to one page</em> and will be making each page personally.</li>

<li>A <em>custom archive</em> page.</li>

<li>More <em>theme options</em> for myself so that I can edit some other info on my page through my interface rather than editing the code.</li>

<li><em>CSS3 animations</em> here and there.</li>

<li><em>Shortcodes</em> for some new things I will introduce in my posts.</li>
</ol>

<p>And the theme will be built on <strong>Bones</strong> like before .</p>

<p>This is what I’ve thought so far but I am sure that more ideas will click me as I work my way through. I do not have a clear idea about the design so far but I am sure that I will do it as I continue. The way I do things is that I <em>“Design by Coding”</em>.</p>
