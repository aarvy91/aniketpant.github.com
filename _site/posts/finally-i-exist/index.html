<p>Hello everyone</p>

<p>This is Aniket Pant.</p>

<p>Well, I have been working on making my website for quite sometime, and I was finished with the work sometime before. It just took me sometime to get the domain though. So, finally I have my virtual existence. :)</p>

<p>Earlier I had made my own website using an HTML template but then I planned to shift to WordPress.</p>

<p>So this is what I have here â€“&gt; My Site</p>

<p>I would keep posting my day-to-day account on what I work on.</p>
