<p>Look upto the sky<br />Watch the rain fall<br />The dark days are over<br />Misery won’t befall you</p>

<p>The light fades away<br />Show yourself<br />Don’t be afraid<br />Watch the sun set</p>

<p>Come down to me<br />These words don’t mean anything to you<br />You just want to kill everything you see<br />Your heart just says<br />Take everything, leave nothing</p>

<p>Don’t you see these ashes<br />Haven’t you seen the blood on the streets<br />What about the girl waiting for you?<br />Remember what she looks like!</p>

<p>Think when she waved goodbye<br />Hoping to see you again<br />Drop this gun<br />Head back to home</p>

<p>Leave this town<br />Back to where you came from<br />This is just another world<br />Another dream, come away with me!</p>
