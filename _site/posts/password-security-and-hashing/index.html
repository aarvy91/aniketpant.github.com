<p>My old problem was not solved by now, and I was going through a question on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>I got to know that MD5 should not be used in anyway. Then I read about SHA1 vs bcrypt. After quite some discussion and thanks to <a href='http://about.me/dclawrence' title='Thanks :'>Lawrence</a>, I got a brilliant solution and really good lesson on password hashing.</p>

<p>Now, I would be using bcrypt to hash my passwords.</p>

<p>See this post for the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7044785/what-is-the-safest-way-to-store-a-password-using-code-igniter/7045061' title='Post'>solution</a>.</p>

<p>To implement this password hashing technique, there is a library available.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the files from <a href='http://www.openwall.com/phpass/' title='PHPass'>here</a>.</li>

<li>Then, extract the files to application/library.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='load_the_library'>Load the library</h4>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;library(&#39;PasswordHash&#39;,array(8, FALSE));</code></pre>

<h4 id='how_to_hash_the_password'>How to hash the password?</h4>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;PasswordHash-&gt;HashPassword($password);</code></pre>

<h4 id='check_if_a_password_is_correct'>Check if a password is correct?</h4>

<pre><code>$password = $_POST[&#39;password&#39;];
$actualPassword = /*Get the hashed password from your db*/;

$check = $this-&gt;PasswordHash-&gt;CheckPassword($password, $actualPassword);</code></pre>
