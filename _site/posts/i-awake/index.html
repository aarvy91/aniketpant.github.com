<p>A dark cloud over the moon<br />Cold air surrounds me<br />I wish I could make the sun bleed<br />And still feel you beside me</p>

<p>Summer is long gone<br />My pen is still ever since<br />These words will be alive soon</p>

<p>We will walk in the rain<br />And get drenched in love</p>

<p>I wonder if my thoughts could reach you like letters<br />Brown paper and a heart<br />But no tear in your eye</p>

<p>If you call for me<br />I want to be there<br />I wish I could<br />I feel I will</p>

<p>I want to make the stars paint your name in the sky<br />Write all my words<br />I, awake</p>
