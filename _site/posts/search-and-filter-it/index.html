<p>Exams are over (again), itâ€™s quite boring and irritating when you have exams every now and then (that is like once every month).</p>

<p>Now they are over, I can resume work *happy*</p>

<p>Thing for this week -</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete front-end work on a project</li>

<li>Challenge : Create a Search with Filtering options</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no idea about what to do with the 2nd task.</p>

<p>So, I am going to post a question on stackoverflow to get some help :)</p>

<p>Here is the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7875492/create-search-with-filtering' title='The Question'>link</a>. (please do post some answers if you can help me out)</p>

<p>Also, here is some work that I did in the last 2 days (made these for fun)</p>
