<p>It has been a while that I have been working on igniteplate and I haven’t been able to put much time to it.<br />Two days back, I happened to read <a href='http://www.ianlandsman.com/2012/02/22/laravel' title='Ian Landsman on Laravel'>this</a>. And then I thought of giving <a href='http://laravel.com' title='Laravel PHP'>Laravel</a> a try.</p>

<p>After being a dedicated Codeigniter developer for so long and even started work on a major project of my own, Laravel was something that took me away.</p>

<p>It’s been only some days that I have been working on it and it’s very different from Codeigniter. It will take me sometime to get the hang of it.<br />I am liking this framework a lot.</p>

<h2 id='dilemma'>Dilemma</h2>

<p>After I have started working with Laravel, I realized that a product like <em>igniteplate</em> is something that can be made with Laravel in a much lesser time.<br />The only reason I wish to continue working on igniteplate is that it hasn’t been done on Codeigniter. And I am sure some developers like myself will benefit for me.<br />Also, there is sure a little attachment to this project because it’s mine.</p>
