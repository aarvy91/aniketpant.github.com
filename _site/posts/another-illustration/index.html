<p><a href='http://hauntedcathouse.org' title='Haunted Cathouse'><img src='http://hauntedcathouse.org' alt='Fun Illustration I Made' /></a> This is another random work of mine.</p>

<p>Maybe cuz I got too high on illustrator a while back, but now I returned to my site design roots.</p>

<p>This was inspired by Carla Ceia’s CV. You can check his site <a href='http://hauntedcathouse.org' title='Haunted Cathouse'>here</a>.</p>

<p>And as for the work I am doing right now, I am making an Online Test Module through ASP .NET</p>

<p>Coming up pretty well.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting it once it’s done.</p>

<p>Also, I guess I never read about multiple text shadows in CSS, but tried them by mistake today. It works.</p>

<p>You can also go for multiple box shadows as they work in the case of ‘inset’.</p>
