<p>Today has been quite a nice day.</p>

<p>I managed to finish pending work.</p>

<p>Did bug fixing in Creative Foliage. Then moved to putting my 2 CSS demos on my <a href='https://github.com/aniketpant' title='My git'>git</a>.</p>

<p>Started work on a HTML theme and then I got an idea to make a <strong>Visual Sitemap Generator</strong> which would be CSS based.</p>

<p>Will get on to making it in a while. Should be fun.</p>
