<p><span><span /></span>The <strong>Online Test System</strong> I have been working on is on the verge of completion.</p>

<p>Today, my focus should have been on “to display the questions when a user starts a test”, but I am sort of stuck at a point. Instead, I fixed the authentication issues.</p>

<p>Also, made the logo for here. It’s done.</p>
