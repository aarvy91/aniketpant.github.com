<p>It’s been a couple more than a week that I was introduced to ASP .NET and my current project has not only taken it’s shape but is nearly completed.</p>

<p>You would be wondering, “What is he working on?”. Well, what I am working on is just another Online Test System.</p>

<p><strong>What it has?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Management – 3 Categories: Admin, Teacher, Student</li>

<li>Questions Type Management</li>

<li>Subject (Add/Edit/Delete)</li>

<li>Class (Add/Edit/Delete)</li>

<li>Questions Management</li>

<li>Paper Generation by some queries</li>

<li>Test Generation by populating a paper</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what it is.</p>

<p>I am through with Paper Generation. What I am left with is the Test Generation and once that is done, I’ll release it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working in ASP .NET helped me learn ASP as well as C#. Plus, the whole logic of how and why to design a database in a way is clear to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will make a whole documentation and put it up as soon as it is done.</p>

<p><strong>Estimated Time of Release:</strong> 9th July 2011</p>
