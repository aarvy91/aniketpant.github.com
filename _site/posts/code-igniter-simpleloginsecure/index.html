<p>Yesterday, I made an attempt to use PasswordHash and tried to directly convert it into a CI Library. Failing at that, I went ahead and downloaded <strong>SimpleLoginSecure</strong>.</p>

<p>Refer to my <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7072968/passwordhash-not-working-with-codeigniter-solved' title='Question on Stack Overflow'>question</a> on Stack Overflow, regarding why I have been talking about Password Hashing so much.</p>

<p>The library is pretty cool. Here is the <a href='http://codeigniter.com/wiki/File:SimpleLoginSecure-1.0.1.zip/' title='SimpleLoginSecure'>link</a> to it.</p>

<h4 id='what_i_did'>What I did?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Put the downloaded file in application/libraries</li>

<li>Made minor table name and field name changes</li>

<li>DONE</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s super easy and it comes with 4 functions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create</li>

<li>Login</li>

<li>Logout</li>

<li>Delete</li>
</ol>

<p>This is all you need in a basic login and it’s all there. Just minor customizations required and *poof*, work done.</p>

<p>And the best part about this library is that it uses <strong>bcrypt</strong> to hash passwords. And that is why it is a beauty. It uses <a href='http://www.openwall.com/phpass/' title='PHPass'>PHPass</a>.</p>

<p>That is all, and I still haven’t got any reply to my <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7006552/form-validation-not-working-in-code-igniter' title='Form Validation - Stack Overflow'>question</a> regarding Form Validation. Really need help with it.</p>
