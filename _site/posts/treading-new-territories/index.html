<p>I feel good today. Really really good. There are just so many things on my mind that I want to write about and work on ideas that I keep noting down in my little spark file. Yes, I have been maintaining a spark file, though I write it in a diary like format.</p>

<p><a href='http://markmyword.in' title='Mark My Word'>Mark My Word</a> has been doing really well. The <a href='http://markmyword.in/speakers' title='Mark My Word - Speakers'>amazing speaker line-up</a> is nearly complete and we are working hard on getting the required finances for making it a success.</p>

<p>The things on my list at the moment are -</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Making Mark My Word a success and continuing with the fun work</strong></li>

<li>Redesigning my website</li>

<li>Renaming my website to <strong>Rawrrr</strong> (Many reasons for it to be called that)</li>

<li>A new cleaner design in all my existing work</li>

<li>Learning OOCSS</li>

<li>Working with inuit.css and building a custom front-end starter project</li>

<li>Discuss with myself whether to shift from WP to Jekyll or not</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not that I don’t like my current design but I am just going to throw away the sidebar from my next design. I am so so bored with having so much of excessive content on my page where anyone would lose focus if you don’t use colors and typefaces properly.</p>
