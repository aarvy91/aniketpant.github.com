<p>It’s been 11 days since I took on this project and it just needs the finishing touch now.</p>

<p>It’s easy to understand that such systems can be made more flexible and can be expanded more and more.</p>

<p>Well, I have tried my best to make it as flexible as I could think of and what was within my knowledge.</p>

<p>The things I am left with are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Result display after a test.</li>

<li>Editing of various records</li>

<li>And some BLING :P</li>
</ul>

<p>Will be up in 2 days as promised (unless some issues come up) :D</p>
