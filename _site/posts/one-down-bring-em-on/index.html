<p>Waves 2011 got over on 5th and I have lazed around since then, not much to do. Well, actually there is lots to do, but recently everything seems lazy.</p>

<p>And this reminds me of The Chariot’s album name -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work on my list -</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish existing projects by this month.</li>

<li>TEDx Goa site</li>

<li>Some CSS demos</li>

<li>Quark event – R.I.P. Open</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday was one of my the most laziest day, this year, I did absolutely nothing (didn’t even check HN every hour). Then I thought that I would write something, but that didn’t work out either. <a href='http://www.64notes.com' title='64 Notes'>King</a> kept bugging me throughout the day, telling me to write something :P</p>

<p>Most of this post is boring, so I will put in some links that I went through yesterday, they are pretty amazing.</p>
