<p>I applied for the <strong>Codeacademy fellowship</strong> a couple of days back.</p>

<p>And then I even went ahead and applied for <strong>Hacker School</strong>. I wanted to do that ever since I first read about it.<br />But I got rejected in a very funny manner.</p>

<p>The only reason I applied for Hacker School was to get a little insight about myself but I got a very very incomprehensible response from their end.</p>

<p>They say this (I haven’t included the entire message) —</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While we don’t think Hacker School is a fit now, we thought you could be a promising candidate. Your application does not demonstrate your actual, intellectual curiosity or mental clarity. We encourage you to apply again to a future batch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I am completely clueless about <em>how to demonstrate my actual , intellectual curiosity or mental clarity</em>.</p>

<p>Then I thought more about it (and I continue to think about it) and finally decided that I need to be more versatile. As of now I know C++ and PHP along with HTML, CSS and other front-end stuff, but I need to head towards some awesome hacker-like languages.</p>

<p>So, right now I am learning <strong>CoffeeScript</strong> (since it lets me work on the web really well) and then I am trying my hand at <strong>Haskell</strong>. If Haskell suits me, then I will try learning more of it and if it doesn’t then I shall try out Lisp.</p>
