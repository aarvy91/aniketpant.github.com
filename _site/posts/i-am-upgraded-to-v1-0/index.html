<p>After roughly three months of unexplainable inactivity and extreme learning experience, I feel that I can start working on core modules of many applications.</p>

<h2 id='learning_over_the_past_few_months'>Learning over the past few months</h2>

<p>The only way I can support the above is by stating a couple of things that I have learnt in the past few months.<br />Here are some tips that you should focus on -</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the best tool</li>

<li>Use the capabilities of your framework</li>

<li>Learn the language better you know best</li>

<li>Rewrite old code and become better</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='crazy_current_situation'>Crazy current situation</h2>

<p>At present I have two options. One takes me back to an old project that I dumped because of lack of functionality in the framework. And the other option is to go for the same old project but instead of a the old framework, I can choose to go for a better one.</p>

<p>The first option will involve lots of code rewriting that I am thoroughly enjoying. But the other one will make my work simpler and will not let me face massive challenges.</p>

<p>But I think that I will ditch both and go for a complete new idea to work on. <strong>And that is contributing to both the frameworks.</strong><br />As of now I know what I can do better and it seems like going for new ideas and working on the core will help me learn better. And along with all of that I will keep fiddling and dabbling with new stuff.</p>

<p>All of this seems so exciting and I am most probably going to stay this way for the next few months.</p>

<h2 id='things_on_my_list'>Things on my list</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shift to linux once again and run AOE III from the Virtual Box. (Because it seems so cool)</strong></li>

<li>Learn to work with micro-frameworks - specifically <a href='http://toroweb.org/' title='Toro: Micro-Framework'>Toro</a> because it’s so cool too!</li>

<li>Write something for <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/' title='A List Apart'>A List Apart</a></li>

<li>Work my way to another redesign that will not be so focused on development but be a mix of my personality and code</li>

<li>Do my best in organising <a href='http://markmyword.in' title='Mark My Word Conference'>Mark My Word</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A shift from applications to the core should be good for me.</p>
