<p>It is all really very stupid but recently I have been remembering my old days on the web. There were so many sites I used to visit that time and play some text based MMORPGs.</p>

<p>I have been playing <a href='http://www.kingsofchaos.com/' title='Kings of Chaos'>Kings of Chaos</a> for the last 5 years now. Never made any amazing breakthrough but ended up within the <em>top 1000</em> always. I have been a dedicated member of LaCN (game based alliance) and have participated in a number of wars.</p>

<p>There were 2 more games that I used to play then. One was <a href='http://www.biocidecity.com/' title='Biocide City'>Biocide City</a> and the other being <a href='http://www.vilecity.com/' title='Vile City'>Vile City</a>. I couldn’t make myself like Biocide City much but Vile City got me hooked. I placed Vile City for a couple of months but left (as I had exams that time).</p>

<p>2 days back, I started playing Vile City again. And I am doing well in it now.</p>

<p><strong>Text based MMORPGs are really great.</strong></p>

<p>Apart from all of this, GSoC 2012 is approaching and I need to try my hand at it. There aren’t many organizations that I can apply for but I will definitely give it a try.<br />My target is to build something for WordPress as I have been working with it for a long time.</p>

<p>Have to start writing a plugin and learn how to meddle with the system.</p>
