<p>Having worked with Codeigniter for over a year, I was finally settling down.<br />It felt so great when I coded on Codeigniter, I could write simple PHP anywhere and never thought much about the whole concept.</p>

<p>I never saw my code from an <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/articles/artistic-distance/' title='Artistic Distance'>artistic distance</a>.</p>

<h2 id='status_quo'>Status Quo</h2>

<p>In the last three months, I was able to work on a small-scale development kit (call it a CMS), which let me customize my application easily for building a medium-sized application.<br />I was able to set admin settings for maintaining various variables, manage users and send off emails &amp; notifications to users.</p>

<p>All I need to do is merge the codes from my other applications into <em>igniteplate</em>.<br />The next stage of development was to implement oAuth support for various social networking sites.</p>

<p>I am not sure about the feeling I have about this, but I am not going to continue working on <em>igniteplate</em>.<br />I will finish merging the pending codes and then end development.<br />The reason is that there already exists a framework that allows me to work in a better and more organised manner.</p>

<h2 id='what_went_wrong'>What went wrong?</h2>

<p>A couple of days, I stumbled upon Laravel as I have mentioned in my <a href='http://www.aniketpant.com/article/a-shift-from-codeigniter-to-laravel' title='A Shift from Codeigniter to Laravel'>previous post</a>.<br />Right now, I am working on a college project and because of Laravel, I realized what all was wrong in my logic.</p>

<p>In the last one week, I have learnt</p>

<ul>
<li>How to design my database more effectively</li>

<li>Object-Relational Mapping</li>

<li>Writing tasks</li>

<li>Using a CLI</li>

<li>And to write a cleaner and more documented code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='tldr'>TL;DR</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Never be satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will be my motto and should be every other person’s who get too close to their beloved idea.</p>

<p>If you liked my post, then it would be great if you <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4070202'>upvote it on HN</a>.The reason for the motto:</p>

<ol>
<li>Satisfaction leads to lower productivity.</li>

<li>There will always be something cooler and more amazing than what you love.</li>

<li>Moving to a new technology lets you learn and improve your methods.</li>
