<p>This year has been going really great so far. I haven’t been able to write anything so far but will be regular now.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of things that have kept me busy and happy at the same time. The two events I am managing for my college’s festival <a href='http://bits-quark.org' title='Quark 2012'>Quark 2012</a> are going well.<br />I will soon share the problems I have created for one of the events. The other event is the treasure hunt and it’s called <a href='http://edorado.bits-quark.org/' title='E-Dorado'>E-Dorado</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from this I haven’t been able to put much time into <a href='http://dabblet.com/' title='Dabblet'>dabbling</a> and this is the only <a href='http://dabblet.com/result/gist/1593706' title='The Pretty Button'>good thing</a> I have been able to make so far.</p>
