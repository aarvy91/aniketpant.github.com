<p>Inspiring someone is awesome but it’s the other way round for me.</p>

<p>I love to be inspired more than I love to inspire others. It’s just too exciting to read and learn from what other’s are doing. I read posts from many web developers and I keep on making me better. Trying to grasp all I can is too exciting and a beautiful experience.</p>

<p>I have been working on a project on Code Igniter and I am using inuit.css in it. Earlier I was a little apprehensive against using a front end framework as I didn’t consider them useful, but now I understand the power. Things become too simple and clear.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='http://csswizardry.com/inuitcss/' title='inuit.css'>inuit.css</a></li>

<li><a href='http://baselinecss.com/' title='baseline.css'>baseline.css</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Another small occurrence of a miracle was when I was working on a small project of mine (actually I still am, it’s not complete so far), I just used baseline and it was <strong>beauti-fied</strong>.</p>

<p>I love using new technologies and trying to experiment with them in my projects, to make things <strong>AWESOME</strong>.</p>

<p>Kudos to <strong>Code Igniter</strong>and** inuit.css<strong>, my project is coming up well.</strong></p>
