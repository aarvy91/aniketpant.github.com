<p>My last post on <a href='http://www.aniketpant.com/article/html5-semantics-and-good-coding-practices' title='HTML5 Semantics and Good Coding Practices'>HTML5 Semantics and Good Coding Practices</a> received a great response and a total of <strong>6.4k</strong> hits so far!</p>

<p>It’s a great thing for me. So from now on I have decided to write an article of this sort every week. One good article a week. Seems good to me.</p>

<p><strong>The Bones of HTML5</strong></p>

<p>To be frank the title of the post is misleading. A lot of people would think that I would be writing on HTML5 and it’s structure &amp; things.<br />But actually the post is going to be on how <a href='http://themble.com/bones/' title='Bones Framework'>Bones</a> (WordPress Framework) uses HTML5.</p>

<p>Bones is my favorite framework and my current theme is based on it! So I plan to write on how it uses HTML5.</p>
