<p>My latest self project is coming off really well. In the last 2 days, I have made quite a progress.</p>

<p><strong>Codeigniter + Template = Igniteplate</strong></p>

<p>This is how the name came up and since then I never bothered to delve more into then name. I find it stupid to find reasons and change things when I have started work on them.</p>

<h2 id='the_changes'>The Changes</h2>

<p>So, the latest changes in Igniteplate are —</p>

<ol>
<li>Change in design and layout.</li>

<li>Twitter Bootstrap 2.0</li>

<li>Prefixfree</li>

<li>Documentation</li>

<li>A temporary logo</li>

<li>Font Awesome instead of the default glyphicons</li>

<li>A trello board</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='change_in_design_and_layout'>Change in design and layout</h3>

<p>This was my first concern to deal with once I had started work on it. For the last 6 months, all my CI projects had a similar layout and it wasn’t very flexible. The current layout gives me more scope for new elements to be placed here and there.</p>

<h3 id='twitter_bootstrap_20'>Twitter Bootstrap 2.0</h3>

<p>I have upgraded the <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/' title='Twitter Bootstrap 2.0'>Twitter bootstrap</a> version and made all the required changes.</p>

<h3 id='prefixfree'>Prefixfree</h3>

<p>No more headaches of putting vendor prefixes before my css properties. <a href='http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/' title='Prefixfree'>Prefixfree</a> does it all for me.</p>

<h3 id='documentation'>Documentation</h3>

<p>I have started documenting all my work on Igniteplate and created a simple help book so far. Will continue to add more content to it.</p>

<h3 id='a_temporary_logo'>A temporary logo</h3>

<p><a href='http://thenounproject.com/' title='The Noun Project'><img src='http://thenounproject.com/' alt='Igniteplate Temporary Logo' /></a>This is the temporary logo for Igniteplate.</p>

<p>I have just colored it. That’s all I did. The two parts are from <a href='http://thenounproject.com/' title='The Noun Project'>The Noun Project</a>.</p>

<p>I used a <a href='http://thenounproject.com/noun/fire/#icon-No1571' title='The Noun Project : Fire Logo'>fire</a> logo and a <a href='http://thenounproject.com/noun/plate/#icon-No1059' title='The Noun Project : Plate Logo'>plate</a> logo and came up with this. Even if I continue to use this, I need to make it more intricate, as I find this really stupid and simple.</p>

<h3 id='font_awesome_instead_of_the_default_glyphicons'>Font Awesome instead of the default glyphicons</h3>

<p>The reason for this shift is that a font gives me more freedom for playing with the size and colors of each element.</p>

<p>This is what <a href='http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/' title='Font Awesome'>font awesome</a> is.</p>

<h3 id='a_trello_board'>A trello board</h3>

<p>Instead of posting more and more twitter updates on this. Checkout the Igniteplate <a href='https://trello.com/board/igniteplate/4f6b6503d7df4bc57a04c0e0' title='Igniteplate on Trello'>board</a> on Trello.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/aniketpant/igniteplate' title='Igniteplate'>Checkout</a> Igniteplate on github.</p>

<p>I am working on Social Auth at the moment. Should take me another week to get done with it and come out with a version 1.4</p>
