<p>After a long time of illogical brainstorming, I finally got to know why form validation was not working in Code Igniter (in one page.</p>

<p>You can see the question over <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7006552/form-validation-not-working-in-code-igniter-solved' title='Question'>here</a>.</p>

<p>What actually happened is while declaring the rules for the validation, instead of writing</p>

<pre><code>field</code></pre>

<p>, I wrote</p>

<pre><code>name</code></pre>

<p>Just this much and my code started working. Now I am over to the next portion which is developing a search.</p>

<p>Also, yesterday I started using <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com/' title='TiddlyWiki'>TiddlyWiki</a>. It is a really nice thing to stored your journals. Try using it once for sure.</p>
