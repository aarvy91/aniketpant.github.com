<p>For the last few days, I have been working on multiple projects and trying to <em>open my mind</em> to more and more ideas.</p>

<p>As of now, one of my hands is deep in this project I am doing for my college, I will be releasing the code once it is implemented. And the other project is <a href='https://github.com/aniketpant/grade-app' title='GradeApp on Github'>GradeApp</a>.</p>

<h2 id='gradeapp'>GradeApp</h2>

<p>This is a little project I decided to work on to better my skills. I will explain about it in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id='what_exactly_is_it'>What exactly is it?</h3>

<p>A single-page application for calculating your CGPA.</p>

<h3 id='whats_so_cool_about_it'>Whatâ€™s so cool about it?</h3>

<p>For the user, it would be just a good interface and lightning fast speed.</p>

<p>For the developers, I am using <a href='http://slimframework.com' title='Slim Framework'>Slim</a> (a PHP micro framework) and <a href='https://github.com/frankkohlhepp/store-js' title='Store.js : A powerful toolkit for localStorage'>store.js</a>.</p>

<h3 id='why_am_i_working_on_it'>Why am I working on it?</h3>

<p>The reason for working on this tiny application is to understand PHP micro frameworks as I have worked with many frameworks but never glanced at the <em>micro</em> ones. And I thought it was time to look for alternate storage types. And localStorage placed as the perfect candidate for this project.</p>

<p>I work on <strong>GradeApp</strong> in my free time so the progress is a little slow as I have two projects than need to be completed.<br />Hope it comes out well.</p>
