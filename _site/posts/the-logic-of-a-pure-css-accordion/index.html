<p>You may have seen <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/pure-css-accordion/launch' title='Pure CSS Accordion'>this</a>, or you might not have.</p>

<p>The logic behind making this was, I had seen an accordion on some site, it was a little different than what I have made (actually very different)</p>

<p>What happened in it was, when I hover on one element, it expanded but the width of the accordion remained the same. That accordion used jQuery, and I always try making things with <strong>minimum or no jquery</strong>. Its not like I’m against using jquery but I try avoiding it</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I sat for a couple of hours thinking how I can achieve it. But then there was no way I could link one CSS effect to change another element’s appearance (unless it’s contained in that element).</p>

<p>So, I thought, what if I can just make the display into something else, with the width changing and a scale effect but not inside it, rather giving it a feel as if it floats another level up :) Not very innovative, but that was the only thing I could think of for making it a <strong>Pure CSS Accordion</strong>.</p>

<p>I have used two pseudo selectors together to achieve the first-child and the last-child effects. What I have done is that I combined “:first-child” and “:last-child” with a “:hover”. If you use it properly, it can do wonders :D</p>

<p>This is all for this post. Tomorrow I begin work on a new CSS technique. Wait for it.</p>
