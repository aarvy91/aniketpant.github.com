<p><span><span>WP Format Code</span></span></p>

<p>Today I finished writing my first WordPress plugin. It’s damn simple and was really easy to build.</p>

<p>I call it <strong>Format Code</strong>.</p>

<p>What it does is that it converts all text enclosed by <code> (grave accent)</code></p>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<h3 id='version_10'>Version 1.0</h3>

<p>I first thought of making it with a fixed styling and that was my first version. Without any possible changes to it! So basically a plugin with no options.</p>

<h3 id='version_11'>Version 1.1</h3>

<p>The one includes 2 themes – Light &amp; Dark along with padding changes.<br />So you can have a defined length of the code block you create.</p>

<h3 id='version_12'>Version 1.2</h3>

<p>I included a live preview in the <em>plugin options</em> page. So, you can actually see the changes you are making.</p>

<h2 id='future_changes'>Future Changes</h2>

<p>Currently I am thinking of more ways in which I can improve and enhance my plugin, so that it becomes more usable by people.</p>

<p><em>Note: I will soon be uploading the plugin on my github and also on the WordPress plugin directory.</em></p>
