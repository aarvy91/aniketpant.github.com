<p>Don’t just breathe<br />Feel life<br />The life in my veins</p>

<p>Well I’m not dead<br />Blood flows through my veins<br />I’m no puppet of yours<br />My heart beats fast<br />Faster than you can speak up,<br />For yourself!</p>

<p>Untie your hands<br />Let your thoughts wonder<br />Into a dreamland<br />Don’t let him drive you to his Doom!</p>

<p>Sadness is not all around me<br />It just find some pieces in my life<br />Ruins, not everything is like that<br />Find what you want<br />Take it and keep it safe<br />Don’t let misery fall upon it!</p>
