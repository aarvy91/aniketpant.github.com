<p>I just began my work on my new theme.</p>

<p>The basic reason for it was, as I wanted my site to have a more professional look and better readability. Will take some more days to finish with it.</p>

<p>The theme is based on <a href='http://themble.com/bones/'>Bones Framework</a> (in love with it).</p>
