<p>Minimalistic Me returns with a bang and now it’s cleaner, more readable and amazingly prettier.<br />I shall not make you wonder more about the name Minimalistic Me. It’s the name of my old theme.</p>

<h2 id='origin_of_name'>Origin of Name</h2>

<p>I am not one bit aware of the exact definition of <em>minimalist</em> but I guess my previous design incorporated it pretty decently.  But the new one does the job better.<br />To me minimalism means a clean background, no funky patterns, readable fonts and a fluidity. I guess the fluid part means the most as it gives it a frameless layout.</p>

<p>Earlier, I planned the theme name to be The Return. Then I tried out some other names too but they just didn’t fit. So, I finally settled with <em>The Return of Minimalistic Me.</em></p>

<h2 id='the_new_theme'>The New Theme</h2>

<p>All the themes I have made so far were quite rigid. Now, rigid here is a very big term as it has a specific meaning for me.<br />If people say that WordPress does everything for me and I doesn’t take me much effort to keep making changes to my blog. For me, it’s a completely different thing.</p>

<p>In the present situation, WordPress doesn’t do everything for me. I need to make changes to my codes if I want to changes some elements.<br />Now, people would begin to say <em>“what an ass he is”</em>. He wishes to create a set of another CMS based operation in a CMS.<br />My answer to that would be a mighty YES.</p>

<p>I wish to make changes to a lot of my static content which comes from templates from my admin controls only. And I have started making changes to my theme to incorporate them. And for making these changes all you need to know is* how to develop theme options.*</p>

<h3 id='features'>Features</h3>

<p>There are many new features in my theme and I will list all of them with a brief on each.</p>

<h4 id='theme_options'>Theme Options</h4>

<p>There is a text box that I have in my theme options menu that allows me to edit the <em>about me info</em> which appears on my home page.</p>

<h4 id='shortcodes'>Shortcodes</h4>

<p>There are two shortcodes that I have created.<br />This a little sidenote created for display purposes only.One allows me to make</p>

<p><em>sidenotes</em> in my posts. Sidenotes are disjoint text contents that appear onto the left of my posts.<br />The other makes a <em>view demo</em> button. All I need to do is send a link to it.</p>

<h4 id='functions'>Functions</h4>

<p>There are a number of other functions that I needed for a long time and I have finally understood how to make the best use of functions.php.<br />The about me text and shortcodes are all written in this amazing file.</p>

<h4 id='twitter_follow'>Twitter Follow</h4>

<p>At the end of each post you will find a rectangular block with a message on it. That’s a button that links it to my twitter profile.<br />I had seen this sort of thing being used at a number of website and I found it pretty cool. So I included it in my theme too.<br />Its done via a tiny PHP code that picks up a random line from a defined list and displays it in the block.</p>

<h2 id='final_say'>Final Say</h2>

<p>According to my plan, I was supposed to take a week to finish off this theme. But to my surprise I did it in 3 days.<br />I will keep on building more features to it.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate a response to my blog’s redesign.</p>
