<p>After nearly one full day of traveling, I have reached my hotel room.</p>

<p>Let me first describe the journey a bit.</p>

<p>I started on 13th Oct evening from Goa, took a bus to Mumbai (that takes like 12 hours). Reached Mumbai at 7:00 AM, boarded a train at 12:30 PM for Jabalpur and reached here at 4:30 AM. Quite hectic, but now I am very much excited for todayâ€™s events.</p>

<p>It is going to be super fun. In the next hour or so, we will be leaving for the venue.</p>
