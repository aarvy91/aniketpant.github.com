<p><a href='http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/' title='Chris Spooner'><img src='http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/' alt='' /></a> This is a simple illustration I made through this amazing tutorial by <a href='http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/' title='Chris Spooner'>Chris Spooner</a>.</p>

<p>It’s pretty awesome and this is what I came up with in the end. Not as good as the tutorial but still brings happiness :D</p>
