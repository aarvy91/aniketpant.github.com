<p>For quite sometime I was busy reading articles for design inspirations and finally I have found what I have been looking for.</p>

<p>First thing is that I need to clean up the code for my last two themes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Creative Foliage</li>

<li>Fallen Leaves</li>
</ol>

<p>I recently updated these two on my <a href='https://github.com/aniketpant' title='My git'>git</a> too.</p>

<p>To Do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Leave Creative Foliage</li>

<li>Make Fallen Leaves “My Creation”</li>

<li>Work on getting my themes better and more “theme-like”</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Also the recent source of inspiration is <a href='http://graphicdesignjunction.com/2011/07/75-best-xhtmlcss-websites-in-the-month-of-july-2011/'>this</a></strong></p>

<p>And now I need to get back to writing some new <strong>original stuff</strong>.</p>
