<h2 id='the_start'>The Start</h2>

<p>Two days ago, I told <a href='http://www.64notes.com/' title='64 Notes'>King Sidharth</a> to help me with an idea for an article for <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/' title='A List Apart'>A List Apart</a></p>

<p>Having no idea on what to write on, he suggested to write on <strong>HTML5 Semantics and Good Coding Practices</strong>. Yesterday, I began writing it. It will take sometime as I am busy <em>studying for my exams</em> which will start in a week and playing <em>Assassins Creed 3</em> (not liking it much, finishing it because I stated off with it)</p>

<p>One of my goals for this year was to get an article of mine, published in <strong>A List Apart</strong>. An attempt for that is the one I am working on!</p>

<h2 id='the_article'>The Article</h2>

<p>So, the article is coming out fine. What I’ll do is, I’ll post the headings under which I am writing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>

<li>The Changes in the Sections</li>

<li>Groupings</li>

<li>How to use the additions</li>

<li>Good Code</li>

<li>My View</li>

<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<p>Hoping that it comes out fine!</p>

<p>Apart from this, there hasn’t been anything interesting for quite sometime now. Even HN is getting boring for me now, no good things coming up! Weird!</p>

<p>And the worst part is that I got the copy of Inheritance in the beginning of the month, and I haven’t read it after the 5th chapter. This is so sad :(</p>
