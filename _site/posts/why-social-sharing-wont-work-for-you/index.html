<p>Social media marketing was a big hype a couple of years ago and now it is dying. Or I should say it’s dead. The fashion is gone and now’s time of bringing out what your product really is.</p>

<h2 id='the_problem'>The problem</h2>

<p>Social sharing won’t work now because we have options now.<br />As a consumer, I have many options now. I am specific about what I want and there is not bullshit that figures on my list.</p>

<h3 id='case_facebook'>Case: Facebook</h3>

<p>I will give a simple example of what I do. At the moment, my Facebook feed is divided into <strong>multiple lists</strong> and mostly it’s just brands &amp; the pages I have liked there. I have unsubscribed many people, because I do not want to see <em>9GAG</em> on my feed the whole day.</p>

<p>If you think that you can market your product and get a following just my a simple Facebook page, then you’re wrong. I guess you haven’t been on the lookout for what all features the consumers have. I can <strong>unsubscribe</strong> you and most of your marketing team the moment I see boring updates from you.</p>

<p><strong>And the best part.</strong>If you think that when your team shares your statuses, links and picture; They are not reaching many people. Most of your shares are left out in your small circle of people.</p>

<h3 id='case_twitter'>Case: Twitter</h3>

<p>If you think that a simple <strong>hashtag</strong> on Twitter will get you all popular, then I won’t be on the lookout for your tweets anymore.</p>

<p>A hashtag is not enough to build a following. You need to interact with your users, you need to get down to real business. Not just petty tweets with your hashtag.</p>

<h3 id='case_internet_memes'>Case: Internet Memes</h3>

<p>This is the current generation which is running wild. We have <strong>rage comics</strong> and <strong>internet memes</strong> coming out ever single minute. People post new stuff on 9GAG &amp; similar sites and the rest of the world spends their whole day sharing them on Facebook.</p>

<p>I clearly remember the Facebook generations.</p>

<ol>
<li>First Generation: <strong>Posting on walls.</strong> This is what Facebook was meant to be.</li>

<li>Second Generation: <strong>Farmville.</strong> People went mad after this gaming and we would get request everyday to <em>be their neighbors</em>.</li>

<li>Third Generation: <strong>The Meme.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Right now, we are part of  <strong>The Meme</strong>, which surely has sucked the life out of me. I get tired of seeing them the whole day and just like me, many people ignore them. So, marketing via memes might not do well.</p>

<h2 id='how_to_fix_this_problem'>How to fix this problem</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Be Relevant and Timely<br /></strong>Share relevant information. Don’t go around sharing your home page every day.</li>

<li><strong>Breaking out your hashtag to the world isn’t everything<br /></strong>There are other approached you can adopt. Tweet your followers and be on the lookout of what the consumers want.</li>

<li><strong>Interact and Participate<br /></strong>Sharing isn’t everything. You need to talk to your followers and get some discussions going around.</li>
</ol>
