<p>I just learnt that I cannot host my ASP site on my current hosting as is it is Linux based.</p>

<p>So, what I will do is, when I done with making the manual. I will post it here :)</p>

<p>And maybe sometime later, when I make it better, I might go for a windows based server and host it. Till then I will keep working on making it better.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Note to make: An issue with ASP based websites, that they cannot be hosted on a Linux Based Server.</strong></p>

<p>Windows is a little weirds, but not possible to <strong>NOT</strong> use it.</p>
