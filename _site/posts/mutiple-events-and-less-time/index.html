<p>This last week has been quite a time for me.</p>

<p>Had to make the <strong>TEDxBITSGoa</strong> teaser page. (I wonder why what I made wasnâ€™t liked by them :|)</p>

<p>Next, I had work on the existing project, and thanks to my Dad, I got to know the importance of correct flow of data in a website (or be it anything)</p>

<p>Now, we have the <a href='http://2011.jabalpur.wordcamp.org/' title='Wordcamp Jabalpur, India'>Wordcamp Jabalpur, India 2011</a> coming up soon.</p>

<p>I need to start working on the theme soon and come up with something <strong>simple, minimalistic and amazing</strong>!!</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I plan to start with the website skeleton :)</p>
