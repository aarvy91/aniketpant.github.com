==============

The website is pure handcoded HTML written over the brilliant [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) platform. It is served via the amazing [GitHub](https://github.com) and only [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) is used. **No crapware guaranteed.** The [source code](https://github.com/aniketpant/aniketpant.github.com) has been specially kept for you to fork it.

I wrote the entire site using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) with Frontier [Color Scheme by Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes).

The design of the website has been hugely inspired by [Ben Schwarz's site](http://germanforblack.com). The fonts used are & [Cubano](https://typekit.com/fonts/cubano) & [Source Sans Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and served by Typekit. The pretty colors you see are are `#BF2C47` and `#037F8C`.
